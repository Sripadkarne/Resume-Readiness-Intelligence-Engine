# AgenticAI-ResumeHelp-w-RAG

ResumeJobHelpAI is a web-based application that uses agentic AI, RAG, and targeted learning pathways to help job seekers evaluate their readiness for specific roles and grow the knowledge they are missing. Unlike tools focused on “gaming” interviews, our mission is to enable real skill development through structured learning, curated resources, and personalized practice.

🧠 Problem Statement

Job seekers—especially in Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI Engineering—often struggle to assess whether they are qualified for a role and to identify the skills they need to improve. Existing AI tools generate answers but don’t actually teach.

Our solution:
A Job Readiness Intelligence Engine that evaluates a user's current skills, detects knowledge gaps, and generates targeted study pathways using high-quality, credible resources. No shortcuts. True knowledge growth.

🎯 Intended Users

#Primary users (MVP scope):

Data Science candidates

Machine Learning Engineer candidates

AI Engineer candidates

#Planned expansion:

Software Engineering

Finance

Mechanical Engineering

#Additional technical and non-technical career paths

Both entry-level and senior candidates

#MVP Features
1. Skill Gap Detection

Users upload their resume or answer domain-specific questions.
Our system:

Analyzes skills, tools, and domain knowledge

Compares them to real job requirements

Returns structured “knowledge gap” outputs

2. RAG-Based Knowledge Retrieval

The RAG database is built from credible sources:

ML & Statistics textbooks

Ace the Data Science Interview

Applied DS/ML/AI resources

Curated articles, videos, PDFs, and tutorials

The engine retrieves explanations, examples, and runnable insights—not generic fluff.

3. Personalized Study Plans

For every knowledge gap, the system generates:

Sequenced study modules

Videos + articles + textbook excerpts

Hands-on exercises

Timelines and difficulty progression

4. Practice Question Generator

We use agentic AI to produce:

Targeted practice questions

Increasing difficulty levels

Answer explanations based on the RAG knowledge base

#High-Level Architecture

#Frontend:
Built using Lovable (React-like UI).
Communicates with backend through REST API calls.

#Backend (GCP):

Cloud Run – hosts API server (FastAPI / Python)

Vertex AI – embeddings, RAG retrieval, LLM generation

Cloud Storage – raw documents for ingestion

Firestore – user sessions, progress, study plans

Cloud Functions (optional) – lightweight utilities

#RAG Pipeline:

Document ingestion

Chunking & preprocessing

Embedding generation

Storage in vector DB (e.g., Vertex Matching Engine or self-hosted)

Retrieval + reasoning layer
